      Faculty of Environment, Society and Design: supporting you to achieve your
      PhD goals
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gaining your Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at Lincoln creates opportunities
      to challenge yourself with new ways of thinking and problem-solving. We
      understand this journey can be demanding and are here to support you every
      step of the way.
      <br />
      <br />
      A crucial element of your PhD study is the completion of six-monthly
      reports (6MRs) to track your progess and address any issues as they arise.
      Lincoln Universityâ€™s Postgraduate Monitoring System streamlines the
      reporting process.
